# CSCI3170_2018-2019


Compiling procedure:


1 Create a MySQL database
2 Change the connection details in the .java file for your own sql database location and details

Tested on Windows 10
Tested Java version: Java 8u251
Commands: (Windows 10 cmd)
1st line: javac CSCI3170Proj.java
2nd line: java -cp .;mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.jar CSCI3170Proj


The overall functions work while there were many mistakes made in the system (as it was an old project handed in when I was very new to coding, not everything inside works)

Can be fixed if interested

Thanks
